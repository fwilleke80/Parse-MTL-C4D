# Parse_MTL.py
##### Version 1.1.3


## Usage
1. Open Cinema 4D. 
2. Go to "Script -> User Scripts -> Script Folder..."
3. Place Parse_MTL.py in that folder. 
4. You will probably need to restart C4D, but afterwards, goto "Script -> User Scripts -> Import .mtl file..."
5. Select the mtl file you wish to import.
6. The script will import the materials from the file.

This is NOT my script. I merely edited a couple lines to turn off the specular channel if the settings in the mtl were 0 for specularity and to link to absolute values for paths. The original script is found at http://www.c4d-jack.de/site/

Note (by fwilleke80):
www.c4d-jack.de is not available anymore, but the script can now also be found at: https://github.com/fwilleke80/Parse-MTL-C4D

### ToDos

I'd like to add a toggle to change between absolute paths and relative paths.
